# Rock Paper Scissors In Python
This is a little project I did with my daughter in Python 3.9 while I took a course on it. 
## Free & Open Source for anyone to use
`Requires 'pip install keyboard' module to play`

### Future Updates

I would like to add a user interface to this one day and probably will.
